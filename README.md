## identify customers -> identify customer segments
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

In this project, I analyzed demographics records for customers of a mail-order sales company in Germany, evaluating it towards demographics information for the overall populace.I used unsupervised learning strategies to perform patron segmentation, figuring out the elements of the population that great describe the core client base of the enterprise. Finally the outcomes have been summarized in a Medium weblog post located [here:](https://medium.com/@essamedo11/strategies-to-use-unsupervised-machine-learning-techniques-to-identify-customers-cb06e2921d00)

## Results

Within the project each general populace (Germany) and clients populace have been compared. Segments have been identified that could be goal for future advertising and marketing campaigns or to be considered outdoor of organisation interests. Typical portrait of a client for various segments became described.
